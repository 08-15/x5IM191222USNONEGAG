                <p class="mbr-text pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-5">General: Spam-X works with iMap accounts only and it is an eMail Agent, that supports your email clients with special features and functions. 
<br>It can be installed on one of your Windows computers (if you use more than one) to control up to 5 accounts independently. The machine to choose should be the one which is most of the time online (as the normal functions could be managed remotely via mail from other PCs), thus it could be even a home server or just the notebook you use mainly. Please note, that Spam-X eMail Agent cannot work if it is installed on a computer which is not turned on or not connected to the Internet.
<br>Important: Your email client and Spam-X eMail Agent working at the same time and by chance one of both is the first. Due to that technical solution, you might see a mail of a not ACTIVE sender briefly for some seconds, before it will be handled by Spam-X (it will be deleted while in Responder Mode or replaced by X-ray, depending on your settings). You should not open those original mails, as it is for sure an unknown sender.
<br>While mails from your Active community will be untouched and appear as usual in the inbox, any UMO (Unknown Mail Object) what was replaced by X-Ray should be clearly identified by its Subject line content and style. As a proof of safety, it must show the name of your Personal Assistant! &nbsp;<br></p>

If the trial period ended, all account will change to “Responder Mode”. You can upgrade to PRO any time, during or after the trial period. Simply click the UPGRADE BUTTON on the dashboard and follow the PayPal payment terminal. After payment, the Mode Controls will be selective again. Please set accounts as liked.

Click request installation code, check your mailbox and wait for the incoming Spam-X message. Copy and paste the ID into the interface. Go ahead with your account password. If the setting is fine, there should be a scan to register your existing mailbox users. Just be patient, it might need some minutes, if there are many messages in the mailbox.

Thus, you can enjoy individual mode settings, different currency responders etc. for any of your registered accounts. Just click on the account name to open the menu. It shows:
</p><p><strong>1.	Account name
</strong></p><p><strong>2.	USD Responder
</strong></p><p><strong>3.	EUR Responder
</strong></p><p><strong>4.	Register Radar
</strong></p><p><strong>5.	Function Settings

</strong></p><p><strong>1) Account name:</strong> Shows the name of account the menu servs.
</p><p><strong>2) USD Responder:</strong> Select the best matching Responder for Paid Mail function by currency and language (if you click on one of the Images, a larger view will pop out).
</p><p><strong>3) EUR Responder:</strong> Select the best matching Responder for Paid Mail function by currency and language (if you click on one of the Images, a larger view will pop out).
</p><p><strong>4) Register Radar:</strong> Our Radar table shows all recorded accounts of your mail community. Besides the email account names there are 3 columns, A for ACTIVE accounts, B for BLOCKED accounts and &gt; for VIM forwarding. 
</p><p>After installation the APP looks for the mail addresses which are in the respective account. Those addresses will be recorded as ACTIVE users and will not be recognized in the APP handling at all. If a mail is received from an unrecorded user, that mail account will be recorded only in the first step, means added on the Radar list. At that stage it is not classified as ACTIVE or BLOCKED, and further activities depending on the account Mode setting. It is always possible, to change the status, e.g. with the related radio buttons it could be selected as ACTIVE or BLOCKED or even changed between the 2 possibilities. One more feature comes with the checkbox in column &gt;: If checked, mails received from that sender will be forwarded to the VIM email address (if VIM address is recorded on the dashboard). If the sender should not be forwarded anymore, simply uncheck the checkbox. Please note that sender must be set as ACTIVE to realize forwarding.  
</p><p><strong>5) Function Settings:</strong> Any account has its own individual setting and user can select between:
</p><p>a.	<em>Responder Mode</em>: If a not registered sender sends an email, Spam-X will reply with the selected Responder to ask for payment. If it is a serious sender with an important message, the sender can pay by PayPal and thereafter, the initial message will be forwarded as a “Paid-message” in the save “X-Ray” format, without active hyperlinks, to protect you from dangerous activities. If the sender should be part of your mail system, just return the X-Ray message to activate the sender. Thereafter, the original message will be delivered in your inbox. If you don’t like this sender to be part of your community, just delete the message. That sender will have a second chance to send you one more mail. Thereafter the address will blocked by the 3rd and final approach. 
</p><p>
</p><p>b.	<em>Monitor Mode</em>: This mode will not respond on incoming mails for not registered senders but will forward the original mail as an X-Ray message into your mail box. Now you can check the content. If the message is welcomed, you can Register the sender with just two clicks: 1. Click reply; 2. Click send. That will activate the sender and return the original message back into your inbox. That easy! Please note: If you do not take any action on an incoming but not registered sender’s mail (or just delete it), the sender has a second chance to write to you. If again, you take no action, this address will be blocked automatically, if there is a third attempt.
</p><p>
</p><p>c.	<em>Auto-Block</em>: By default, the Auto-Block function will be “ON”.  As the result, any not registered sender will we blocked once Spam-X detect the sender’s third mail in the incoming folder. Therefore, your Spam-X is “learning by doing” and your incoming spam will decrease dramatically, and no user activities are needed! However, if you prefer not to block any unregistered sender, you can set the function to “OFF”. Due to the protection mode, you will get any mail as a safe X-ray preview. 
</p><p>
</p><p>d.	<em>Message format</em>: By default, Spam-X works with X-ray messages and the user see the whole content on one glance (like a luggage check at the airport). That function needs HTML format, nowadays the common standard for most mail users. However, there is the possibility to switch to text mode and depending on the mail clients involved, it will be just plain text content. The links in those messages are neutralized and will not work for the initial target, to protect from malware traps.
